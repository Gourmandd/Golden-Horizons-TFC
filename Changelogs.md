# Changelogs

All of the changelogs since 0.1 that was posted on Modrinth

# Golden Horizons 1.6

## New content

This changelog covers all non Aether changes. The Aether related changelog will come later with version 1.7.
Depending on how long it takes for things to cool down, Create and addons will be updated for Create 0.6v next release, if they don't then I will hopefully bundle the updates along with the changes ive wanted to make to the TFC compatibility I made for Create.

- TFC addons like Casting with channels, precision Prospecting, and hammer time have been added.
- Performance has been improved, I have noticed lower RAM usage so far.
- Added a fancy menu for the modpack, you can see it in the main menu and the in game pause menu.
- Electrum is treated like most of the TFC metals
- More recylcing recipes have been added
- A Wax table item was added, it cannot be "locked" like a book and quill.
- Map Atlases allows you to chart your world, and share that with others.
- Create Big Cannons metals have been given the TFC treatment, and are now known as Harderned Steel, Cast Iron Alloy, Aluminium Bronze, and Nethersteel kept its name.
- Added TFC like coloured lenses for use in Exposure Cameras.
- Shutters have been added
- Breezy has been added and made compatible.
- Immersive Aircraft's aircraft now require Aluminium which is found in the Aether (sorry for the inconvenience since the Aether isnt accessable yet, a process involving kaolin will be added soon anyways).
- "Gem sandpaper" has been added as a weaker version of diamond grit sandpaper.
- Ore powders can now be melted.
- Caupona cooking vessels should now be knappable and fired.
- Many small fixes to crafting recipes, involving glass, food and more.
- Vanilla blocks with no recipes in TFC that have interactions like furnaces, and smokers are no longer interactable and are decoration blocks. Recipes for them have been added.
- Create Saws now is crafted with a sawblade, made using the anvil.
- Custom barrel recipes now have proper lang tags in their GUI.
- Some of the modpacks textures have been updated, with more to come.

Many mods were updated, since many bug fixes for small to large issues were released.

Mod updates with content:
- Knights Of Terra Firma (black,red,blue steel armour)

Fixes to modpack and mod content should make running servers with the modpack easier.

- Most mods are on their latest versions (including Firmaciv which has new dependancies)

### Mod removals

Burnt has been removed, this might cause lighting errors where the blocks were. If there are any other issues please let me know, it may come back in the future as there are plans for the mod to move away from MCcreator which may be more performant.

True Darkness Forge is also gone, it doesnt work with shaders (If there is a way then it may come back) and in general is annoying, nothing stopping you from adding it into your mods folder if you like it.

### Mods added

- Ambient sounds
- Hidden Names

- Corn Delight
- Barbeques Delight
- Barrels 2012
- TFC sacks and such

## 1.3

A variety of things got done, and some bugs were actually fixed (I may or may not have had gone a little too hard on Ctrl + Z)

Create recipes that were changed were changed again so that they are closer to the originals. TFC rotation things are now for the early game as Create mod water wheels and windmills were disabled (windmills may come back, but with a larger size requirement then the default 8)

## 1.2

Over the past few months I've been working one some custom clay types and while the textures will change over time everything else is finished!

![5 clay types, 4 new ones and bricks, vessels and molds made from them. Types left to right: Kaolinite, Porcelain, Yixing, Yellowware and Earthenware](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/fe46bd8e417178204b4b5997decf3d8bfee1c2b8.png)

TFC rotation things are no longer hidden, in preparation for the next major update which will rework Create mod progression.

- Every Compat
- Create: Interiors
- Functional TFC 
- Functional Storage
- Load my F***ing tags (Should make sure broken tags that I don't know are broken from breaking stuff)

### Bug fixes

- You can now make canoes.
- Fixed a few tips

### Enjoy :3





## 1.1

### I recommend to update to this version, as it fixes an important recipe.

### Fixed a few bugs

- Welding recipes for double cast iron ingots used wrought iron ingots.
- Loom recipes using any type string were broken.
- Cutting Terracotta brick slabs no longer can be used to duplicate them, you can also recycle shingles now.

### Revelationary - Mods Added

Revelationary was added but is disabled by default for now. It will be on by default in a future update.

To enable it, go to your launchers page that lists mods, search and enable the following mods:

- Revelationary
- Sinytra Connector
- Connector Extras
- Lazurite

Revelationary allows more tight knit progression by "cloaking" blocks and uncloaking them when you get a certain achievement. To be able to see any ores you need to get any copper tool (keep in mind you don't need ores for this in TFC as you collect the "pebbles" or can also use river deposits). As you get better tools relevant the rest of the ores will be uncloaked.

When ores are uncloaked (this is generalised as there are a lot of them)

Copper tools **unlocks** copper ores, ores needed for bronze and minerals that can be mined with copper tools

Bronze tools **unlocks** iron ores, and minerals that can be mined with bronze tools

Steel tools **unlocks** The ores needed for black, red, blue and stainless steel

Black steel tools **unlocks** Ores for minerals that can be only mined with black steel tools (like diamond and ruby)





## 1.0

Various mods were updated
