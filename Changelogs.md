# Changelogs

All of the changelogs since 0.1 that was posted on Modrinth

# Golden Horizons 1.9

After this update the mod list is nearly finalised. I am thinking of setting up a Java profiler and seeing if anything uses more RAM than is worth it. The integration of Spectrum is going well, I wouldn't recommend going to its dimension yet since I dont have hardened stone and collapses to working properly but almost everything else is ready.

## New Content

- Rustic Delight was added, allowing you to make many new food items using existing items like peppers and calamari. (and ingredients for batter, which can be used for pancakes!)
- Create has been updated to version 6, some recipes were edited to be more reasonable. (given vaults are made from blue steel and were used in some recipes.)
- Rustic Delight adds two crops, which has been given the TFC crop treatment. You can find Cotton in warm and medium-rainfall areas and Coffee in warm and dry areas.
- When placing cobblestone with mortar in your off-hand or by right-clicking it with mortar, you can mortar the cobblestone meaning it no longer landslides. (it still collapses like raw stone.)
- Create mod windmills and water wheels are now craftable, and usable, just place the waterwheels in the river the same as you would with TFC ones, (and not like you normal do with Create waterwheels).
- Aluminium can now to made, by charging "raw aluminium mixture" which is made from kaolinite and redstone. This aluminium is used for aircraft.
- You can now craft honeycomb, should allow a few more building blocks and a few recipes to be made.
- You now use Firmalife's beeswax instead of honeycomb to wax copper blocks.
- [CHANGE] Hammering of blooms and weak steel is now done with presses since Vintage Improvements has not updated.

## Spectrum Integration

- Spectrum's wooden blocks now craft into and use lumber like in TFC.
- Amaranth has been made into a proper TFC like crop.
- The stone types found in the dimension act like other TFC stones, having cobblestone and loose rocks and so on.
- These stone types also had some of their names changed:
Vanilla stone -> Argillite
Deepslate -> Nephelinite
Dripstone -> Travertine
Basal Marble -> Picrite Basalt
- Enchanter had some obsolete enchantments removed.
- Spectrum's structures should use TFC blocks when applicable. (some vanilla blocks just drop TFC variants, such as flowers since TFC's barely bloom.)
- The dimensions worldgen was slightly adapted to use TFC blocks (stone blobs use TFC stones and the hard-coded large ore veins had their block swapped.)

## Modlist Changes

- Create and addons updated to newest versions.
- Added Create: Picky Wheels
- Added Rustic Delight
- Added Block Swap
- Added TFC Water Flasks
- Removed Vintage Improvements
- Removed Vintage Kubejs
- [RESOURCE PACK] Removed Lopy's Copper Coating
- [RESOURCE PACK] Added Old Copper Stuffs

## Enjoy :)

The "expanded" scope of the modpack is seemingly getting close to being finished, custom content and suggestions will be more of a priority. I might try to look into this idea expanding soap and chalk making: https://tree.taiga.io/project/gourmandd-golden-horizons-ideas-suggestions/us/30?kanban-status=10332830 .

# Golden Horizons 1.8 

This update sees a good few random bits and bobs, mostly from mod updates. The beginning of the TFC x Spectrum compatibility has been implemented, Spectrum's early to mid-game should be fully accessable (keep in mind that the ores are a bit tricky to find). No compatibility other than recipes has been made to the lategame, while "the place" is accessable I havn't touched it at all. Some minor nitpicks also need to be sorted out with Spectrums earlygame. Create v6 in the modpack is on the horizon, Create Big Cannons just released a beta release that is compatible.

I'm considering making a public Trello board for ideas and concepts, aswell as tracking certain features. Any thoughts?
I don't think I can make the board items publically editable but ping me and I can make a suggestion item for you, plus it means you don't need a Trello account.

## New content

- Spectrum's worldgen features are now seen in the world, watch out for mysterious rocks and basalt spheres!
- Almost full recipes compatibility for Spectrum with TFC, most recipe types were checked over.
- Added Architects Palette and made all its recipes compatible.
- Reworked how to get polished and brick blocks from other mods and vanilla. (considering making it an in-world interaction?)
- Loot table auto compatibility script, this might have been the hardest part of adding structures: making sure players didn't get vanilla items instead of TFC ones.
- New hand-drawn modpack icon. 
- Fixed a few misc recipes like for cannon parts, that were unobtainable or missing.
- Added TFC music support to Now Playing (it shows the right name and artist)
- I want feedback on this, Vanilla music (only C418 tracks) has been added as a uncommon track to play instead of just having the 4 same TFC tracks playing. Menu Music is the same (except for a little secret).
- Updated TFC Artisanal, did some minor additions to its new content.
- Updated Simple Voice Radios, this is a large update and the create themed resource pack has been removed since it was for a much older version of the mod. (I might try to make something similar.)

## Modlist changes

Added

- Firmaciv+
- Async Locate
- Flevorium
- Now playing
- Forge CIT (support for resource packs, but also for an idea I have)
- Architects Palette

Removed
- Crabbers Delight (didn't really fit in with everything else, and bit of a pain to configure)
- TFC canes (content overlap with Sacks and Such)

Resourcepacks

Disabled by default. I added my new resource pack that changes the TFC bush models.

## Enjoy :3

I'm hoping to add some new crops next update.

"the place" will require so many worldgen tweaks... This is going to be a headache.
Atleast I already know what I'm doing because of the "Aether incident".

# Golden Horizons 1.7

This release sees a pretty big changes in the modpack, the Aether X TFC compatibiity has been abandoned due to technical issue probably within the Aether or Addon, or other mods in the modpack. Technical/backend changes have also occured. Due to (ironically) greater stability Im thinking of doing TFC compatibility with Spectrum. Spectrum and the mods needed for it are included in this update so that people can report any issues earlier.

## New content

- EMI info tabs have been added for a large amont of items, every stone type, ore, gem, metal, and crops have a info page.
- Create casings are now made with Firmalife treated wood blocks.
- Updated modpack textures.
- Aluminium is now refined from kaolinite, it is used for aircraft. (Changes to make kaolin easier to find might come soon).
- Custom clay types have better compatibility in recipes now.
- Vintage improvement is a create addon with various new recipes types, they have been integrated into the modpack with more to come.
- Small tweaks to game menu. (removed a button from main menu, and pause menu, and added a few icons).
- You can now boil water! **There is no penalty to drinking "dirty" water**. Boiled water gives you regeneration for 10 seconds (liable to change) when drunk from a jug. 
- Create splashing recipe to turn gravel and sand into minerals have been rebalanced.
- Recipes types that are not used, or self explanitary (Example. Automated shaped crafting is just crafting, again, in another recipe tab) were removed from view (they still exist in the game).
- Recipes for terracotta shingles and bricks were changed.
- A greeting message to the player, when they join a world has been added. (a way to make this optional might come soon)
- Jade no longer shows how much health a mob has, for immersion, PVP and other reasons.
- A large amount of the modpacks scripts now use common values and functions, this makes it easier to write scripts for the modpacks development.
- I have done no benchmarking so take with with a grain of salt, but performance may have improved after removing Aether + Addons.

## Modlist changes

- Vintage Improvements.
- Fog looks modern now. (optional)
- Kubejs Create.
- Kubejs Vintage Improvements.

# Golden Horizons 1.6

## New content

This changelog covers all non Aether changes. The Aether related changelog will come later with version 1.7.
Depending on how long it takes for things to cool down, Create and addons will be updated for Create 0.6v next release, if they don't then I will hopefully bundle the updates along with the changes ive wanted to make to the TFC compatibility I made for Create.

- Shutters have been added
- Breezy has been added and made compatible.
- Immersive Aircraft's aircraft now require Aluminium which is found in the Aether (sorry for the inconvenience since the Aether isnt accessable yet, a process involving kaolin will be added soon anyways).

- Ore powders can now be melted.
- Caupona cooking vessels should now be knappable and fired.
- Many small fixes to crafting recipes, involving glass, food and more.

Burnt has been removed, this might cause lighting errors where the blocks were. If there are any other issues please let me know, it may come back in the future as there are plans for the mod to move away from MCcreator which may be more performant.

True Darkness Forge is also gone, it doesnt work with shaders (If there is a way then it may come back) and in general is annoying, nothing stopping you from adding it into your mods folder if you like it.

Create recipes that were changed were changed again so that they are closer to the originals. TFC rotation things are now for the early game as Create mod water wheels and windmills were disabled (windmills may come back, but with a larger size requirement then the default 8)

## 1.2

Over the past few months I've been working one some custom clay types and while the textures will change over time everything else is finished!

![5 clay types, 4 new ones and bricks, vessels and molds made from them. Types left to right: Kaolinite, Porcelain, Yixing, Yellowware and Earthenware](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/fe46bd8e417178204b4b5997decf3d8bfee1c2b8.png)

### Enjoy :3





## 1.1

### I recommend to update to this version, as it fixes an important recipe.

### Fixed a few bugs

- Welding recipes for double cast iron ingots used wrought iron ingots.
- Loom recipes using any type string were broken.
- Cutting Terracotta brick slabs no longer can be used to duplicate them, you can also recycle shingles now.

### Revelationary - Mods Added

Revelationary was added but is disabled by default for now. It will be on by default in a future update.

To enable it, go to your launchers page that lists mods, search and enable the following mods:

- Revelationary
- Sinytra Connector
- Connector Extras
- Lazurite

Revelationary allows more tight knit progression by "cloaking" blocks and uncloaking them when you get a certain achievement. To be able to see any ores you need to get any copper tool (keep in mind you don't need ores for this in TFC as you collect the "pebbles" or can also use river deposits). As you get better tools relevant the rest of the ores will be uncloaked.

When ores are uncloaked (this is generalised as there are a lot of them)

Copper tools **unlocks** copper ores, ores needed for bronze and minerals that can be mined with copper tools

Bronze tools **unlocks** iron ores, and minerals that can be mined with bronze tools

Steel tools **unlocks** The ores needed for black, red, blue and stainless steel

Black steel tools **unlocks** Ores for minerals that can be only mined with black steel tools (like diamond and ruby)





## 1.0
