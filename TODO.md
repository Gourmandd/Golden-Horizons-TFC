# TODO

This is a roadmap/todo of sorts and as anything gets done it will be moved to the bottom and crossed off.

# Planned Features/tweaks

- A way to get potion effects, this will be done through Caupona and its way to give potion effects to ingredients (Probably done through [This Way](https://github.com/TeamMoegMC/Caupona/wiki/Spice-Recipe) or [This Way](https://github.com/TeamMoegMC/Caupona/wiki/Full-guide-to-add-frying-&-cooking-recipe#ingredient-handling), both links are to Cauponas wiki on github), A modpack:brew_ingredients tag already exists which is a list of items that could be possibly be ingredients for the "brews". Some guidelines are about 30 seconds of effect should be the max, as 9 ingredients can be used at one time and level 2 effects should be handed out rarely.

- Aether, there are some addons can also be integrated. This is easily the most time consuming and difficult feature, any work on this will go on a seperate Git branch. A seperate list of all the additions tweaks etc will come here at some point, since working down a list is far easier for me (main dev, _Gourmand) and anyone else involved.

- Tweaks to TFC artisanal, all sources should be equal and give perishable sugar, and then a refining step should make it unperishable.

- Rebalancing to food values added by the modpack and Farmerls Delight TFC, some guidelines is that crafted food should have the hunger of all its (cooked) Ingredients combined and maybe a bonus, same with nutrition, and bonuses for nutriton, decay time and hunger given to finished meals(so most "meals" in farmers delight and food items at the ends of their crafting trees)

- Proper Exposure support, some work is needed on the recipes, tags and also the data for lenses (see their wiki on github). The coloured lens items exist and have textures but are hidden in EMI.

- Clean up Kubejs Scripts, most edits to recipes can be done with datapacks, some of these are conveniently labled and some of these will require datagen

- Feel free to suggest any assorted additions, some that are in mind are: Snow shovel (can only mine snow, but really good at that) and Snow Bricks. Aswell as playing cards.
## Concept Features

These can change or are not fletched out properly. Though some of these are thought out and more likely to be added (the checkbox emoji)

- Expanded soap making, soap is "poured" on the floor and once it sets (like mud bricks) it can be cut and harvested. ✅
- Similar to the one above but for chalk making, will require a lot of datagen. ✅
- Additions to the TFC guidebook. Similar to Addons it will have a chapter with modpack related info. Some of the additions could also be adding notes into the guibe book about changes or additions the modpack makes. EX a "note" from the modpack in the mechanical power page on how to look into this before Create since Create power is steam engine exclusive. (low Stress vs High Stress network?) ✅
- Adding metals, this might just be done through an addon mod and there are a lot of various ideas, the issues is finding more then 1 or 2 uses for a metal.
- Adding and making minor compat for a mod that adds radios. (keep in mind that the mod needs to be available on Curseforge **and** Modrinth)
- HeatJS allows for better TFC x Create compat, in theory the blaze burner can be replaced though how stuff will be done is up in the air.
- Compat with a mod that adds some more in depth butchery system, of any kind. It could even be a "in-house" solution done through KJS though that might be difficult.
- Expanded ore and chemical processing, without adding gates to existing ore processing AKA just melting the ore. This could be inspired by real life and could include things like slurry and tailing.
