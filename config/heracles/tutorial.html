<h2>Tutorial</h2>
<p>These Quests will guide you through the progression of TerraFirmaCraft and other mods in the modpack. They help you learn about things and the world around you.</p>
</p>Quests in Golden Horizons are fully optional to the progression, they try to smooth out the learning curve of TFC, Create and Others </p>
<p>Quests are split into groups. Each group has a set of quests that you can complete. You can complete quests in any order you want, but some quests may require you to complete other quests first.</p>
